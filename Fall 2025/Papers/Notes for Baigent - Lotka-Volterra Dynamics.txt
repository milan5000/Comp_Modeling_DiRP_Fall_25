Baigent - Lotka-Volterra Dynamics

Ashton's Notes
- Model is similar to SEIR in construction.
- Exponential growth of each population.
- Prey cause proportional growth in predators.
- Predators cause proportional decline in prey.
- Autonomous system.
- Exact solution exists, but is defined implicitly as a family of level sets.
- Phase plots show how neither species can go extinct, instability from small modifications of initial conditions.
- Adding in logistic terms gets rid of oscillations, but adds in results like extinctions, population explosions.

Questions for Discussion
- What are the assumptions of the Lotka-Volterra model?
- Why might we be interested in studying a model like this?
- What is a phase plot? What can it tell us?
- What might a phase plot for a pendulum look like?
- Can either species die out?
- How does modifying the coefficients change the solution?
- How does modifying the initial conditions change the solution?
