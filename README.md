# Fall 2025 Computational Modeling DiRP Group

> This Directed Reading Program is intended to expose UT Computer Science undergraduate students to research in the field of Computational Science and Engineering. Students will meet weekly for a semester reading and discussing papers, as well as collaborating on light projects which introduce numerical methods and develop coding skills.

This repo contains all my collected work for this DiRP group.
